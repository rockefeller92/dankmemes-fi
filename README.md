***Important*** -> The smart contract is not on mainnet, but it's deployed on a mainnet fork I'm running here:

URL: http://DM-ME-ON-DISCORD-FOR-URL

ChainId: 1337

Open Metamask, click the network at the top, select "Custom RPC", and enter the info above.

Select a wallet with USDC and you should be able to see balances and trigger buys.

I've been testing IPFS deployment with Fleek, it has worked at times but was

It's visible in half-working form here:
