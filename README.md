***Important*** -> The smart contract is not on mainnet, but it's deployed on a mainnet fork I'm running here:

URL: http://DM-ME-ON-DISCORD-FOR-URL

ChainId: 1337

Open Metamask, click the network at the top, select "Custom RPC", and enter the info above.

Select a wallet with USDC and you should be able to see balances and trigger buys.

I've been testing IPFS deployment with Fleek, it has worked at times but was
broken last I checked. Not sure why a lot of the resource files are 404-ing.
Fleek support says I need to perhaps use "hash routing", which I intend to try
when I get a chance. It's visible in half-working form here:
